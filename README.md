# Health care Django backend Template

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python Django project. In this sample, I used `django` to build a web application and the `unittest` to run tests.

- Open the template folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder...)
- Create a Python virtual environment using the Python: Create Environment command found in the Command Palette (View > Command Palette). Ensure you install dependencies found in the `pyproject.toml` file
- Ensure your newly created environment is selected using the Python: Select Interpreter command found in the Command Palette
- Create and initialize the database by running `python manage.py migrate` in an activated terminal. 
- Run the app using the Run and Debug view or by pressing `F5`
- Run tests by running `python manage.py test` in an activated terminal
